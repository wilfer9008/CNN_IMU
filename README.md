# CNN_IMU
Implementation code and parameters od the CNN-IMU presented in the Journal "Convolutional Neural Networks for Human Activity Recognition using Body-Worn Sensors"

Updating in progress.

## For testing
Protoxtx files and caffemodels (weights for caffe) are found in CNN_IMU_rep

run main.py selecting the dataset and the network type.


## Networks 
Networks, their configurations per dataset and the solver are found in CNN_IMU_rep/src/CNN.py

## Dataset
Pamap2 preprocessing found in CNN_IMU_rep/src/preprocessing_pamap2.py
